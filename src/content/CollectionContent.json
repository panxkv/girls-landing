    "text": "Our NFT project is a collection of 10,000 randomly generated pieces of artwork focused on presenting the beauty of diversity, inclusivity, and equality. Our art is a way of manifesting that we as female entrepreneurs are ready to take on all the challenges but also the future opportunities that Web3 has to offer. We’re no longer waiting on the sidelines to gently whisper our names, we’re here to create noise and start sharing what we know with each other. With the digital revolution happening right in front of our eyes, we are fully aware of the limitless possibilities and while our collection might be “one small step in the NFT world” it is by far a “one giant leap for us”. Girls run the World to the Moon!!!!!"
