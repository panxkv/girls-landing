  "text": "The purpose of the Girls run the World project is to empower female entrepreneurs so when they’re stepping at their own start line, they’re ready to run and chase dreams, knowing they’re strong, fearless, and unstoppable. We believe in the power of networking and learning together and we are on a mission to provide not only as many useful resources as possible but also share it with each other and with other entrepreneurs globally! We are simply ready to step into the future together, holding the hands of millions of wonderful women all around the world!",
  "second_text": "We envision the time when women are united and know their value, set goals, share experiences, and learn from each other. We hope to one day see our incredible community of all the girls who stand on top of the world knowing it truly belongs to them. As we are constantly observing the growth as more projects enter the NFT space, we are also learning about the importance of having more women actively involved in the NFT and Web3. Women make up only 19,2% of the entire NFT Market and we believe there is so much that can be done! The beauty of the NFT is that there is so much more to that than just a definition. It can be explained from many different perspectives because each and every one of us sees it differently. For some of us, it’s all about the art, while for others it’s about the message behind it. This is why we want to encourage more women to join the movement and find their space in the NFT World!"
